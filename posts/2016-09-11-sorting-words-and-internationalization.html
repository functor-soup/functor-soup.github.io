<p>Sorting words … who knew things would get hairy when you realize that ascii/utf encodings favors the English language when it comes to sorting .. so normal <code>lexiographic</code> based sorting will not work for other languages.</p>
<p>An example of such a problem?</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode clojure"><code class="sourceCode clojure"> (<span class="kw">sort</span> [<span class="st">&quot;beta&quot;</span> <span class="st">&quot;beeg&quot;</span> <span class="st">&quot;alpha&quot;</span>,<span class="st">&quot;zelda&quot;</span>,<span class="st">&quot;écrit&quot;</span>])</code></pre></div>
<p>the result comes out to be: <code>(&quot;alpha&quot; &quot;beeg&quot; &quot;beta&quot; &quot;zelda&quot; &quot;écrit&quot;)</code></p>
<h2 id="lexiographic-sorting">Lexiographic Sorting</h2>
<p>Lexiographic sorting, if someone has to ask me what it is, the best explanations I can them is the first simple one:</p>
<p><code>Sorting words to be ordered to be as they would be in a dictionary</code></p>
<p>Stupid but it works. Stupid because the ordering in a dictionary is based off lexiographic ordering. I have explained the concept by giving an everyday example of the result of such sorting.</p>
<p>The second way would be</p>
<pre><code>An Empty List of Words is already lexiographically sorted.
A list of one word is already lexiographically sorted.
Divide and order a list of words based off their first letter into sub-lists. Subdivide and order the words within the sub-lsists
into sub-sub-lists based off their second-letter, and continue the same till you reach the last letter of the longest word in the each of the resultant sub-sub-...-lists, and then flatten the lists. Hurrah!!!!</code></pre>
<p>this is still stupid, as I doubt anyone would follow and also this describes the method, but not what lexiographic sorting is.</p>
<p>Well hopefully the combination of the ways of complaining the concept magically rings a metaphorical bell in your mind.</p>
