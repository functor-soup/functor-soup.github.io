<p>I’ve started off going through Benjamin Kovac’s <a href="https://www.kovach.me/posts/2018-03-07-generating-art.html">Generating artwork with Haskell</a> and ended up with trying to master the Cairo API.</p>
<p>One of the things I like the most about Haskell (among so many other things) and it’s related libraries is any project ends up as a game no different than playing with Lego. Everything you do ends up as an activity of making sure the different pieces fit each other. And of course Haskell is always a blessing to work with.</p>
<p>Now into the thick of it. What I plan to do is to give a brief intro to the idea behind cairo but won’t expand beyond what is already given in the <a href="https://cairographics.org/tutorial/">official tutorial</a> and follow that up with some direct code port from the mentioned official tutorial link to Haskell and throw in my mix of things.</p>
<h2 id="warning">Warning:</h2>
<p>I’m just an idiot goofing about with Cairo and Haskell and this write-up is just me writing down my results of experiments with Cairo and Haskell. This is definitely not a Pro-written tutorial</p>
<h3 id="cairo-basic-rundown">Cairo: Basic Rundown</h3>
<p>Cairo operates on three layers i.e</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The final destination (the layer that will contain the final result)</li>
<li>The Mask (or the blueprint)</li>
<li>The Source (the ink that get’s pressed through the mask)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: I have yet to understand what sort of advantage this sort of abstraction gives anyone. As of now it’s just a novel idea to me, though other than that it has nothing going for itself. This may change in the future.</p>
<h3 id="first-steps-with-haskell-and-cairo">First steps with Haskell and Cairo</h3>
<p>Let’s attempt to do draw a rectangle on a white surface, the code is pretty straightforward (imo of course), here it is in all it’s glory and hopefully the comments direct it (Hopefully you have stack set up, a new project with cairo as a dependency and keep <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cairo-0.13.4.2/docs/Graphics-Rendering-Cairo.html">this hackage link</a> open in a tab for reference, API docs help alot pals and gals)</p>
